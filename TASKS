TODO TASKS for RHEV-Tools
-------------------------

- standardize usage(), etc.
* Used the term "Usage" for the content on how to use the tool and "Usage information" on how to get the usage info.

- standardize logging (debug, logger, stdout, stderr)

- importvm in rhevtools: check if the given VM is available in the export domain

- additionally to having a global default in /etc/rhev-tools/defaults.conf, it would be nice to have a user specific one too,
  eg. to store the password or maybe ONLY a file to store the password? 
  
- list_all_vms.py: - TODO: Move some of the useful calls into the library
